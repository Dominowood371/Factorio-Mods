page_aai-signal-transmission_text_1=Signal transmitters and receivers are circuit-network-connected buildings that allow moving circuit signals across vast distances for only the cost of electricty.\n\nCircuit network signals are sent and received based on channels. Signals sent on one particular channel, will only be received by receivers listening for that channel. Any number of Signal receivers may listen to the same channel; they will all get the exact same signal. Any number of Signal transmitters may output to the same channel; the signal received from that channel will be the sum of the signals transmitted by all Signal trasmitters outputting to that channel.\n\nGreen and Red wire inputs are kept separate within each channel all the way to the output. This means that a signal put into a Signal transmitter on a red wire will only be output by a Signal receiver to a red wire.\n\nSignal transmitters and receivers only work properly when they are at full power. If the electric network they are on is strained (yellow or red in the electric network GUI), they will stop sending and receiving signals.
